    "4. You can also check out [this tutorial](https://github.com/markf94/rigetti_training_material) by guys from [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com). It was designed for the workshops, not self-learning, but there are many hands-on exercises and it will be a good test of your pyQuil skills :)\n",

    "- superposition\n",
    "- entanglement\n",

    "Imagine you're in the mountains and you want to find the lowest valley. In this analogy if we used the classical gradient descent method, you will start from some point and climb downwards until we can't find anything better. Most of the classical algorithms work this way - you are a moving around the mountain range to find this valley.\n",

If this means that the minimum shifts, you do a little step. In the end, the mountains are the same as they were in the previous example and you are standing in the lowest valley.\n",

    "What's happening here is the adiabatic transformation from some initial hamiltonian to the hamiltonian representing our problem. It is proven that if it's done slowly enough, the ground state (state of the minimal energy) of the initial hamiltonian will transform smoothly into the ground state of the final hamiltonian. It is also how the quantum annealers work (e.g. D-Wave).\n",

    "One of the problems is that using Rigetti's quantum computer (or any other gate based machine) we cannot do this transformation in infinite number of infinitely small steps. We need to set how many steps we want and this is what `steps` parameter does. The more steps we have, the higher chance we will get the good result, but we also need more gates and running the algorithm gets longer and longer. Also, it means we have more betas and gammas to optimize. In this metaphore, betas and gammas tell you how exactly should you add new mountains in each step."
